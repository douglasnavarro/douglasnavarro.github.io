            </div><p>You’ve gotten stuck so many times while coding. We all have. Some hard, nasty problem. Many conditions. Maybe this can be broken down into smaller problems. Maybe some dynamic programming could help. There must be some famous algorithm behind this.</p>]]></description>

            </div><p>I’ve had jobs as a developer where I had teammates who were great people, but we did not work well together. Not because we were bad at it but mostly because the culture of that workplace did not reward or incentivize working as a team — or working well as a team.</p>

Nowadays, I’m privileged enough to be working in an environment where teamwork is much smoother, constant, and rewarded, and I can see the difference is huge.</p>]]></description>
